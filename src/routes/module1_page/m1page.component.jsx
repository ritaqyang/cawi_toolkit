            <p>Cultural sensitivity and humility are the foundational pieces to building trust, respect, and meaningful engagement with individuals; this is particularly important when engaging with women and youth immigrants in order to ensure feelings of safety and inclusion. Cultural sensitivity is the knowledge of and respect towards cultural differences (Kubokawa, 2009). Cultural humility involves honouring the beliefs, values, ways, and experiences of other cultures (Tervalon & Murray-Garcia, 1997). Specifically, ongoing learning and reflection about one’s own role in the experiences and power dynamics that affect people from other cultures are also important parts of cultural humility (Tervalon & Murray-Garcia, 1997).

                Studies have found that cultural sensitivity does impact the mental health of refugee- and immigrant-youth (Oppedal et al., 2020). Cultural humility has also been found to be associated with reduced prejudice, threat (Visintin & Rullo, 2021), and with more positive intergroup attitudes and perceptions (Rullo et al., 2022). Moreover, as stated by Brown, Vesely and Dallman (2016), education is “vital to building respect for the worth, dignity, and equality of every individual in our diverse society”. Therefore, ensuring cultural sensitivity and humility in educational spaces is critical for the success and well-being of immigrant students.

                In the journey of cultural sensitivity and humility, there are several key factors. It is foundational to have self-awareness of one’s own attitudes, norms, beliefs, behaviours, prejudices, biases, stereotypes. In addition to knowledge about one’s own background and culture, cultural knowledge of others’ cultures is necessary. This means being open to learning about other cultures while being mindful of not putting a burden of mandatory education on the shoulders of the immigrants themselves. Finally, accountability is key. In the case of immigrant students, accountability refers to holding educational institutions, systems, and agents accountable for providing equity and inclusion. This entails learning about and discussing historical and ongoing racism and discrimination disproportionately experienced by immigrants and other minorities. It is important to become active bystanders and actors of change who create safe and inclusive spaces for immigrant students and who create culturally relevant materials for their use.</p>
