        <HomeSubTitle>UNDERSTANDING SEXUAL & REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH THROUGH AN ANTI-OPPRESSIVE LENS</HomeSubTitle>
            <Text>The current curriculum and toolkit aim to address various topics of sexual and reproductive health (SRH) 
              through the use of an anti-oppressive lens. This package will aim to recognize and dig deeper into the power 
              and privilege of working with immigrant communities and how one can be an effective advocate and educator for 
              them. Various topics of SRH education are often pursued using a white-feminist, cis-gender, and ableist lens 
              without giving any particular attention to the intersectional identities of participants and students who may 
              also be immigrants, refugees, asylum-seekers, or migrants. Through the use of inclusive language, diversity of 
              content, and lived experiences, this package aims to raise awareness on the issues that immigrant communities, 
              particularly women, girls and other gender-diverse folks face, and educate the younger generations on topics of 
              SRH that are often overlooked in the immigrant community.</Text>
            <Text>This resource is intended to support teachers, facilitators, and community organizers particularly serving 
              immigrant communities, however, the content can be utilized to serve educators who may be providing service to 
              non-immigrant communities or broader youth populations. We would also like to acknowledge the intersectionality 
              in SRH which refers to the ways in which an individual's various identities, such as race, gender, sexuality, 
              socioeconomic status, and ability, interact and impact their experiences and access to healthcare related to 
              sexuality and reproduction. Recognizing the intersectionality of these identities is important in order to provide 
              inclusive and equitable health care that addresses the unique needs and challenges faced by individuals from 
              marginalized communities. It is important to understand how these different factors interact with one another and 
              can exacerbate health disparities.</Text>
            <Text>This resource will use language recommendations from Khan et al., 2022 to create a sense of safety for underserved 
              communities such as immigrant women, girls, and gender-diverse folks who are often not given the privilege of attaining 
              culturally appropriate education. </Text>
