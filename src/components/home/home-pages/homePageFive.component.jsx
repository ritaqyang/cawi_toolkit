            <Text>When translators are working with this toolkit, we advise educators, facilitators and teachers 
                to utilize this resource to ensure they are creating safe spaces for youth to bring forward their 
                feelings, thoughts, and perspectives during workshops, seminars, and discussions. </Text>
            <Text>It is important to incorporate inclusive and accessible language when facilitating a conversation 
                on SRH. Language is inclusive when it does not exclude anyone based on characteristics such as 
                gender, physical or mental disability, as well as cultural or religious background. According to 
                Caroline Forsey at Blog Hubspot:</Text>
            <Text>“Inclusive language is the words and phrases you use that avoid biases, slang, and expressions 
                that discriminate against groups of people based on race, gender, socioeconomic status, and ability. 
                When used, you can resonate with more audiences by speaking and writing in ways that everyone 
                understands and makes everyone feel welcome.” (Forsey, 2022).</Text>
            <Text>If you’re wondering, ‘Why is it important to use inclusive and accessible language?’, you wouldn’t 
                be the only one! Lots of people don’t realize the value and importance of speaking in a way that is 
                respectful to all. Let’s think about it. We all use language to communicate with one another, and we 
                all know that the common saying “Sticks and stones will break my bones but words will never hurt me” 
                is actually NOT true. A lot of times, words CAN hurt and words CAN be used as a form of oppression. </Text>
            <Text>On the other hand, words can be very beautiful too (think of all the stories on love out there) 
                when they are used in a certain way. It all comes down to this: willingness. You must be willing to 
                use inclusive language. Using inclusive language will take into consideration other people’s 
                identities, and “offer the validation and acknowledgment of [those] identities” (Jain, 2020).</Text>
            <Text>By not using inclusive and accessible language is disrespectful and ignorant towards those who 
                already face difficulties in life by excluding them which “contributes to the marginalization of 
                people/communities” (Jain, 2020). The use of language greatly impacts our sense of belonging, 
                whether that is in a classroom, a workplace, or within a group of friends. </Text>
            <Text>To conclude, try to use inclusive and accessible language as that will help other people to feel 
                safe, included, and that they belong. As Neha Jain from Medium states, “Inclusive Language acknowledges 
                diversity, conveys respect to all people, is sensitive to differences, and promotes equitable 
                opportunities” (Jain, 2020).</Text>
