            <HomeSubTitle>CULTURAL ADAPTATIONS TO SRH EDUCATION</HomeSubTitle>
            <Text>Cultural sensitivity and humility are the foundational pieces to building trust, respect, 
                and meaningful engagement with individuals; this is particularly important when engaging with 
                women and youth immigrants in order to ensure feelings of safety and inclusion. Cultural 
                sensitivity is the knowledge of and respect towards cultural differences (Kubokawa, 2009). 
                Cultural humility involves honouring the beliefs, values, ways, and experiences of other 
                cultures (Tervalon & Murray-Garcia, 1997). Specifically, ongoing learning and reflection about 
                one’s own role in the experiences and power dynamics that affect people from other cultures 
                are also important parts of cultural humility (Tervalon & Murray-Garcia, 1997).</Text>
            <Text>Studies have found that cultural sensitivity does impact the mental health of refugee- and 
                immigrant-youth (Oppedal et al., 2020). Cultural humility has also been found to be associated 
                with reduced prejudice, threat (Visintin & Rullo, 2021), and with more positive intergroup 
                attitudes and perceptions (Rullo et al., 2022). Moreover, as stated by Brown, Vesely and Dallman 
                (2016), education is “vital to building respect for the worth, dignity, and equality of every 
                individual in our diverse society”. Therefore, ensuring cultural sensitivity and humility in 
                educational spaces is critical for the success and well-being of immigrant students.</Text>
            <Text>In the journey of cultural sensitivity and humility, there are several key factors. It is 
                foundational to have self-awareness of one’s own attitudes, norms, beliefs, behaviours, 
                prejudices, biases, stereotypes. In addition to knowledge about one’s own background and 
                culture, cultural knowledge of others’ cultures is necessary. This means being open to learning 
                about other cultures while being mindful of not putting a burden of mandatory education on the 
                shoulders of the immigrants themselves. Finally, accountability is key. In the case of immigrant 
                students, accountability refers to holding educational institutions, systems, and agents 
                accountable for providing equity and inclusion. This entails learning about and discussing 
                historical and ongoing racism and discrimination disproportionately experienced by immigrants 
                and other minorities. It is important to become active bystanders and actors of change who create 
                safe and inclusive spaces for immigrant students and who create culturally relevant materials for 
                their use.</Text>
            <Text>
                Ultimately, it is important to continually engage in discourses that challenge power imbalances 
                between immigrant students, educators, institutions, and societies; and it is important to commit 
                to self-evaluation and self-critique as a part of cultural humility. Maintaining cultural sensitivity 
                and humility in a teaching role involves being aware of one's own cultural background and biases, 
                and recognizing the diversity of the students and community. Here are a few ways to approach this:
                <ul>
                    <li>Educate yourself: Continuously learn about different cultures, customs, and traditions, and be 
                        open-minded when approaching new conversations or facilitating discussions.</li>
                    <li>Be respectful: Avoid making assumptions or stereotypes about students or their cultures, and 
                        use inclusive language throughout the conversation.</li>
                    <li>Avoid cultural appropriation: Respect the customs, traditions and cultural expressions of the 
                        students and community and avoid making any assumptions.</li>
                    <li>Encourage diversity: Create a positive and inclusive classroom environment that respects and 
                        values different cultures, customs, and traditions.</li>
                    <li>Be open to feedback: Allow students and colleagues to give feedback on how you can better 
                        improve and address cultural sensitivity and humility in your teaching.</li>
                    <li>Be aware of power dynamics in classroom settings: Recognize that as a teacher, you may have 
                        more power and privilege in the classroom, and be mindful of how this affects your interactions 
                        with students.</li>
                </ul>
            </Text>
            <Text>Cultural sensitivity and humility in a teaching role require self-reflection, and a willingness to 
                learn and grow. It requires effort and dedication, but may also bring a lot of benefits to the teachers 
                and students. These are a few ways you can incorporate cultural sensitivity into your teaching approach.

            <HomeSubTitle>Trauma-Informed Approach</HomeSubTitle>
            <Text>It is broadly understood that students face a number of challenges from external factors, other than 
                academics, during their education journey. For example, discrimination based on race or religion can have 
                an impact on a student’s well-being, such as increased anxiety (Maynard et al., 2019) and when faced with 
                topics that they know are considered taboo at home, can create students that are likely to be less engaged 
                in the classroom. As such, a trauma-informed approach is necessary since students that come from immigrant 
                families may be more susceptible to having lived through trauma previously, whether in their home country 
                or simply by identity factors that may be different from their peers. Trauma is multi-dimensional as it 
                includes social determinants like social inequities, institutional inequities, and living conditions. 
                These determinants funnel into downstream consequences including mental health and behavioural health risks. 
                Therefore, a trauma-informed approach focuses on individual harm and injury to a healing-centred practice 
                that fosters possibility and advances collective wellbeing (Klinic).  </Text>
            <Text>Educators can use different healing-focused approaches to make sure their students feel safe and welcomed 
                in their classrooms. These approaches can be applied at the individual, interpersonal, or institutional 
                levels. Individual practices may involve self-reflection through storytelling and healing from one’s own 
                trauma, while interpersonal practices focus on healing relationships and creating meaningful connections 
                (Klinic). At the institutional level, practices, values, and policies that foster well-being is prioritized, 
                like mental health days (Klinic). In the realm of interpersonal practices, restorative circles can be helpful 
                in supporting youth to share their concerns. In the context of one’s classroom engaging with SRH, there could 
                be a support group of students who share a similar background, and actively engage with youth in conversations 
                about their culture and identity, and the fears they may face in response to learning about sexual reproductive 
                health. Educators that acknowledge the need for anti-racist practices in their schools, and engage with students 
                about their anxiety surrounding their own experience with racial bias, help them feel at ease in their classroom 
                as they feel heard. </Text>
            <Text>Further, interpersonal practices also include being aware of how to frame one’s approach to these conversations 
                with their students. Thomas et al. (2019) summarize the six principles for compassionate instruction and discipline 
                in the classroom developed by Western Washington University. These principles include providing unconditional 
                positive regard, empowering the participants, maintaining high expectations, and providing guided opportunities for 
                helpful participation (Wolpow et al., 2009). It is crucial that these principles are accompanied with intentional 
                action to maintain a compassionate and understanding environment where meaningful relationships are built and 
                sustained between staff and students (Thomas et al., 2019). </Text>
            <Text>It would also be beneficial for educators to provide resources for self-care, as not all students will benefit 
                from the same approach. Providing a list with healthy coping mechanisms, such as journaling, meditating, or 
                ensuring that counsellors are present in the school could help students that are experiencing anxiety when faced 
                with SRH topics realize that their reactions are normal and that they are allowed and encouraged to seek support. </Text>
            <Text>
                When trying to incorporate a trauma-informed approach in SRH education, it is important to be mindful and sensitive 
                to the needs of students and consider factors such as past trauma on individuals, while creating a safe and 
                empowering environment for learning. A few ways you can incorporate a trauma-informed approach into your teaching 
                style are:
                <ul>
                    <li>Be aware of triggers: Prior to beginning a section, understand and acknowledge that certain topics may 
                        appear as triggers so it is important to ensure that there are appropriate supports and accommodations 
                        present for those students. Make sure to incorporate content warnings prior to beginning any sections 
                        that may include sensitive information. </li>
                    <li>Teach through a holistic approach: Physical, emotional and mental health are interconnected so try to 
                        provide a holistic approach that addresses education on trauma and its impact on sexual and reproductive 
                        health. </li>
                    <li>Offer support and resources to audience members: Provide a list of resources that individuals will have 
                        access to locally, particularly for those who may have experienced trauma related to SRH. </li>
                    <li>Encourage self-care and compassion: Allow students to check in with themselves and take care of their 
                        emotional, mental, and physical health.</li>
                    <li>Reflect on your own understanding and biases: Throughout the session and conversations, and activities 
                        take time to reflect on your own biases and understanding of trauma and the impact it can have on sexual 
                        and reproductive health.</li>
                </ul>
            </Text>
            <Text>A trauma-informed approach is important to prioritize the well-being and empowerment of students to create a more 
                inclusive and safe environment for learning. </Text>

            <HomeSubTitle>Diversity & Representation</HomeSubTitle>
            <Text>As stated by Elia and Tokunaga (2015), a multidimensional approach to sexual health is important. This approach 
                identifies non-inclusive education and attempts to remedy it so that it serves the diversity of its students and is 
                hence more effective (Hendrick & Howerton, 2010). One-size-fits-all sexual health curriculums are inadequate and 
                problematic for a highly diverse student body (Elia & Tokunaga, 2015). For example, the often explicit ways in which 
                sexuality is discussed in a classroom including both boys and girls may be contradictory to the values or wishes of 
                Islamic families. In turn, cognitive learning theory, which examines the mental processes that give rise to learning, 
                states that we are more capable of learning new information when we have background knowledge and frameworks to that 
                we can attach it (Garcia, 2009). In the context of sexual health, youth come into these topics with different cultural 
                understandings of sexuality, which might cause them to feel alienated by the education they receive. Developing 
                cultural competencies will allow teachers to be aware of the different cultural perspectives on different topics, and 
                thus effectively teach with these perspectives in mind. </Text>
            <Text>A systematic review by Laduke (2022) discusses the ways in which creating an environment that acknowledges and 
                celebrates diversity can positively affect education (Garcia, 2009). Laduke argues that embracing individuality in the 
                form of diverse identities allows for the cultivation of equality in the classroom (Garcia, 2009). Instead of asking 
                students to leave the unique aspects of their identity, such as ethnicity or religion, outside of lessons, it is 
                important to acknowledge them (Garcia, 2009). Teachers must in turn also embrace their own unique background, 
                acknowledging the unique parts of themselves and teaching from it; not only to students from different  backgrounds 
                but also transferring their unique knowledge to all students as a way to foster greater understanding and new 
                perspectives (Garcia, 2009). Personalizing education to suit the diversity of a classroom allows for the creation 
                of new and more advantageous ways to learn.  Overall, creating a culture of diversity and valuing representation in 
                the classroom cultivates an environment in which it is safe for all teachers and students to be themselves, thereby 
                generating inclusive learning experiences, especially in sensitive topics such as sexual health (Garcia, 2009). </Text>
            <Text>
                When teaching sexual and reproductive health, it is important to recognize and acknowledge the different experiences 
                and perspectives of individuals and communities. A few educators can do this by:
                <ul>
                    <li>Being aware of and being sensitive to different cultural norms, values, and beliefs that affect individuals, 
                        understanding and experiences with sexual and reproductive health. </li>
                    <li>You might also want to consider reaching out and consulting with individuals from underrepresented groups 
                        in the planning, development, and implementation of sexual and reproductive health programs.</li>
                    <li>Offer resources and materials that include different voices and perspectives. </li>
                </ul>
            </Text>

            <HomeSubTitle>Working with Immigrant Youth</HomeSubTitle>
            <Text>When working with immigrant youth, it is important to address how structural racism may influence SRH inequities 
                among immigrant youth. According to Valdez et al. (2022), some major themes that have come out of their research 
                include lack of culture-centred SRH support for recently immigrated youth, immigration enforcement and fear 
                impacting access to SRH education and services for adolescents, and perceived ineligibility related to tenuous 
                legal status as a barrier to accessing SRH services. </Text>
            <Text>In order to prioritize youth agency and voice when engaging in SRH education, Valdez and colleagues’ research 
                shows that rooting sexual education curricula in a way that  recognizes local cultural understandings will help 
                acknowledge the structural constraints that young people face (Valdez et al., 2022). </Text>
            <Text>A structural barrier to SRH education is often the translation of English-language curricular materials and the 
                use of translators as the primary strategy for providing sexuality education and SRH care for English language 
                learners. This can be problematic as english-language translation of SRH curricula and resources has historically 
                been a quick fix for making programs more inclusive for immigrant youth community members. This solution is deemed 
                superficial and does not center the deeper histories and current lived experiences, the local cultural dynamics, 
                or the creativity and voice of the communities served (Valdez et al., 2022). In order to address the linguistic 
                barriers and uninformed assumptions that this strategy causes, it is important for us to understand that educators 
                must participate in systemic reforms that will ensure educational equity. </Text>
            <Text>According to Valdez et al. (2022), developing culture-centered sex-ed programs for youth requires us to take into 
                account local cultural understandings, values, and structural constraints in order to position youth into their own 
                agency and provide them with a voice. Strategies that have been promising in the past include didactic and 
                participatory methods such as storytelling, body mapping, story circles, and poetic enquiry. These have helped 
                engage youth, by increasing their sense of autonomy and self-expression, by valuing and amplifying the voices in ways 
                that do not require English-language skills or being spoken. Further, another study by Louie-Poon et al. (2021) found 
                that immigrant adolescents’ knowledge requires needs on STIs, HIV’s, transmission and protection, unintended 
                pregnancy, sexual activity, family planning, pubertal education, navigating the healthcare system, and also 
                confidentiality legislation. Therefore, approaches to SRH education and services for immigrant youth should include 
                cultural sensitivity, intersectional approach, interactive learning, strength-based approach, and reassurance of 
                confidentiality rights (Louie-Poon et al., 2021). An important example of this is the need to have facilitators 
                learn about FGM/C and have the proper training to support youth. </Text>

                Creating a safe space for immigrant youth is imperative when discussing sexual and reproductive health topics. A few 
                ways you can support immigrant youth is by:
                <ul>
                    <li>Create an inclusive and non-judgemental environment by making youth feel comfortable about asking questions 
                        and discussing sensitive topics. You can do this by fostering open communication, and avoiding stereotyping 
                        and biases.</li>
                    <li>Build trust with youth by being sensitive to youth’s unique needs, experiences and cultural backgrounds. Also, 
                        listening actively to their concerns and questions will also open space for dialogue. </li>
                    <li>Provide accurate and culturally relevant information to immigrant youth so they can make informed decisions 
                        about their own sexual and reproductive health.</li>
                    <li>Address immigration-related concerns for those who may have concerns about access to services. </li>
                </ul>

            <HomeSubTitle>Anti-Oppression and Anti-Islamophobia in SRH</HomeSubTitle>
            <Text>The aftermath of 9/11 as well as the harmful stereotypes created by it have had devastating impacts on Muslims 
                across the world, especially in the context of the classroom and educational settings. Not only that but Muslims 
                who may be racialized may face double the burden of stereotypes, oppression, as well as racism in their day-to-day 
                activities. As educators and community advocates, it is everyone’s duty to create safe spaces where Muslims will 
                feel safe and heard. In the context of the current toolkit, it is imperative to create SRH education settings with 
                a sense of safety and confidentiality. </Text>
            <Text>
                Educators can employ some of the following tips to create safe spaces for Muslim and racialized students in SRH 
                education settings:
                <ul>
                    <li>Acknowledge that anti-Islam and anti-Black hate exists in all oppressive education settings. It is important 
                        to address and acknowledge this and also addresses it with your audience to ensure they are aware of the 
                        consequences of their actions such as bullying others based on their religious or racial identity.</li>
                    <li>When discussing content related to racialized students, do not single them out, or create an awkward 
                        environment where they might feel uncomfortable due to their visible identity markers, such as a hijab or 
                        their skin colour. </li>
                    <li>Create a space for open communication and active listening to foster a sense of trust and understanding 
                        among the students. Provide training and resources for educators to understand and also address issues that 
                        are related to race, religion, and culture. Try to ensure that the curriculum that is being taught includes 
                        perspectives from diverse communities. </li>
                    <li>Encourage active participation and input from students in creating and maintaining a safe and inclusive 
                        environment through anonymous ways. Offer support and resources for students who are experiencing 
                        discrimination or harassment. </li>
                </ul>

            <HomeSubTitle>Stereotypes in the Classroom</HomeSubTitle>
            <Text>Gender stereotypes are often deeply entrenched in the ways that sexual and reproductive health education is taught. 
                In their analysis of the political and legal constraints on sex education curriculums in American public schools, 
                Hendricks and Howerton (2010) noted that harmful gender and heterosexual norms tend to be reinforced. For example, 
                elements of abstinence-only education add to the idea that it is the responsibility of women to keep their (male) 
                partners faithful, as well as to refuse premarital sex in order to maintain their “purity” (Hendrick & Howerton, 2010). 
                Sex is often implicitly associated with contamination, and thus, in having casual sex with multiple partners, a young 
                woman loses her “value”. While young women are taught that they are “sexual gatekeepers” of this kind, the idea that 
                young men have little control over their sexual behaviour is reinforced, which is deeply problematic 
                (Hendrick & Howerton, 2010). These attitudes erase women’s sexual agency and the idea that women can have strong 
                sexual desires too, and that these desires are normal. The assumption of heterosexuality present in most curricula 
                also synonymizes sex with vaginal intercourse (Hendrick & Howerton, 2010). There is generally no discussion of any 
                other sexual activity, which results in a failure to normalize non-heterosexual sex between gender-diverse people, 
                or even sexual activity that may be more enjoyable for women specifically. Young people, especially young people of 
                colour, are often moulded into a box of heterosexuality (Elia & Tokunaga, 2015).</Text>
            <Text>Sexual stereotypes related to race can also be perpetuated during education about sexuality. For example, young 
                Black and Latina women are often portrayed as more promiscuous and more likely to experience teen pregnancy 
                (Elia & Tokunaga, 2015). Young people of colour are often not treated with the same forgiveness that is afforded 
                to white youth, because they are perceived as more adult-like (Garcia, 2009). As a result, their sexual activity and 
                their actions can be perceived as more threatening and dangerous, both to themselves and to their communities. When 
                information is presented to them about sexuality, it often portrays them as being “at risk” 
                (Elia & Tokunaga, 2015; Garcia, 2009). </Text>
            <Text>The intersection of identity stereotypes reinforced in common teaching materials with the diverse identities and 
                cultures of young immigrant women may result in it being more difficult to achieve the type of education they deserve. 
                Being aware of these stereotypes and actively acknowledging and countering them is an important step to helping all 
                students to develop a healthy, comprehensive understanding of sexual health. </Text>

            <HomeSubTitle>Immigrant-Serving Community Organizations</HomeSubTitle>
            <Text>According to Statistics Canada (2022), nearly a quarter of Canadians are either an immigrant to the country or 
                permanent residents. This speaks to the need for immigrant-serving community organizations in the country. These 
                organizations can exist on a federal, provincial/territorial or regional level. The Government of Canada has provided 
                a resource that lists various organizations that cater to newcomers to Canada, and the site sorts these organizations 
                by Orientation, Language and Skills, Labour Market Access, Welcoming Communities and Policy and Program Development 
                (<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/partners-service-providers/immigrant-serving-organizations.html">Government of Canada, 2022</a>). 
                This site would be most beneficial for new or current organizations that wish to cater to immigrants. The site also 
                provides a resource service-providing organizations can refer to when assisting newcomers 
                (<a href="https://volunteer.ca/vdemo/EngagingVolunteers_DOCS/VMH_Eng_2016_Print.pdf">Volunteer Canada, 2016</a>).</Text>
            <Text>The Government of Canada also provides a website that allows individuals to search for local organizations that 
                cater to immigrants

                This site is especially useful, as one can search for organizations by postal code, city, province, full address and 
                type of service (which includes services for women, youth and LGBTQ2S+). </Text>

            <HomeSubTitle>Accessibility and Inclusion</HomeSubTitle>
            <Text>Like everyone, children with disabilities have the right to receive an education about their changing bodies and 
                sexuality in a way that is inclusive of their specific needs. This is especially important due to findings that 
                suggest that children with disabilities are more vulnerable to maltreatment, abuse and sexual assault 
                (Murphy et al., 2006; Sullivan & Knutson, 2000), as well as sexually transmitted infections (STIs) 
                (Mandell et al., 2008). However, the needs of these children are often ignored or not met. </Text>
            <Text>Allowing children with disabilities to access appropriate sexual health education is a required step to equipping 
                them with the knowledge of what healthy sexuality and relationships look like, to allow them to become self-determined 
                individuals with their own distinct sexualities (Treacy et al., 2018). To provide truly inclusive SRH, barriers to 
                education must be removed so that students with disabilities are always included in conversations about sexual health, 
                feel represented, and feel that their needs are understood (Treacy et al., 2018). Students’ diverse intersectional 
                identities must be embraced and approached with cultural competence to provide truly equitable sexual and reproductive 
                health education. </Text>
            <Text>
                Educations and facilitators can create more accessible and inclusive spaces by:
                <ul>
                    <li>Understanding the diverse needs and experiences of individuals with disabilities and ensuring that 
                        accommodations are made to ensure accessibility in all aspects of SRH education.</li>
                    <li>Providing information and resources on the various ways in which SRH is impacted by disabilities.</li>
                    <li>Incorporating a variety of teaching methods to cater to different learning styles and abilities.</li>
                    <li>Encouraging active listening and providing opportunities for individuals with disabilities to share their 
                        perspectives and experiences, while fostering an understanding and appreciation of the diversity of identities 
                        and experiences related to SRH within disabled communities.</li>
                    <li>Providing resources and referrals for individuals with disabilities who may be experiencing discrimination or 
                        marginalization related to their SRH.</li>
                    <li>Making sure the physical setting of the education is accessible, and that the materials are accessible to 
                        individuals with different abilities.</li>

            <HomeSubTitle>Cultural Adaptations to Sexual and Reproductive Health Education</HomeSubTitle>
            <Text>It is important to understand ways in which educators and facilitators can make cultural adaptations to the 
                present curriculum and resources. Although there are many ways one can incorporate culture into the curriculum, 
                we will be highlighting four different strategies to do this. Before you begin, please consult our sections on 
                the use of inclusive language and creating safe spaces. It is also important to note that you should never use a 
                ‘one size fits all’ approach. Individuals from the same cultural background may have different needs from one 
                another, so be mindful of that and consider taking an intersectional and trauma-informed approach. To avoid 
                generalizing, it may be important to conduct a baseline assessment on sexual and reproductive health (SRH) topics 
                of the individuals you are working with. </Text>
            <Text><b>Language</b></Text>
            <Text>This one is especially important when working with newcomer populations. It is crucial that you perform a 
                baseline assessment to inquire about the individual’s native language as well as the language they feel most 
                comfortable communicating. It may also be helpful to get an understanding of whether there are multiple languages 
                the individual feels safe communicating with. To make a language adaptation, it is important that you work with a 
                qualified translator to translate the lesson plans into the preferred language. Do not use Google Translate, 
                especially if you do not have any fluency in the preferred language. Another way to make a language adaptation is 
                to hire a facilitator who speaks the preferred language. For example, you could hire a facilitator who is fluent 
                in Urdu or Korean if the group or individual you are working with has a preference for those languages. </Text>
            <Text><b>Delivery</b></Text>
            <Text>It is important to consider adapting the delivery of the lesson plans, such as the setting, accessibility, and 
                costs involved. Due to structural barriers and inequities, many individuals may find it difficult to allocate time 
                for attending SRH seminars or workshops, which is why you may need to shorten lesson plans depending on the needs 
                and interests of the group or individual you are working with. In addition to this, you might also consider doing 
                the lesson plan over an online platform, such as Zoom, to reduce the costs of transportation and time allocation. 
                If possible and allowed, you may consider conducting the lesson plan in the individual’s home if they feel 
                comfortable doing so.</Text>
            <Text><b>Family Involvement</b></Text>
            <Text>Many cultures place a high value on family involvement and family-oriented values, which is why it may be helpful 
                to include family members in lesson plans or seminars. You can do this by also inviting family members to community 
                lessons or seminars in addition to the immigrant youth. However, keep in mind that some family members may not feel 
                comfortable being in the space, and it is important to respect that. Furthermore, always inquire the youth if they 
                feel comfortable with having their family present before extending an invitation. </Text>
            <Text><b>Cultural Norms and Practices</b></Text>
            <Text>The inclusion of idioms, folk stories, and culturally relevant scenarios into the SRH content may be helpful, 
                especially when working with ethno-racial minorities. Due to historical oppression against marginalized groups such 
                as Black and Indigenous folks, it is imperative to understand that there may be mistrust towards individuals in 
                healthcare spaces, including spaces where SRH education is delivered. It is important to meet people where they are 
                and understand their needs and comfort level through a trauma-oriented approach. In this case, this may mean that you 
                learn about their culture and traditions in order to respectfully incorporate them into the content and conversation. 
                If you are not sure about something, do not assume you know what it means. It is also important to consider hiring a 
                facilitator that may identify with the same community as the students or their families in order to increase comfort 
                and a sense of belonging. </Text>
