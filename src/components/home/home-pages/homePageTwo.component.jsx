        <HomeSubTitle>WHAT IS IN THE CURRICULUM & TOOLKIT?</HomeSubTitle>
              <Text>The curriculum intends to bring sexual health education to immigrant women, girls, and gender-diverse folks by 
                making SRH knowledge accessible. Additionally, we aim to increase confidence and self-efficacy in our participants in 
                the hopes that they are better able to advocate for their own sexual and reproductive health needs. Through our efforts, 
                our team also hopes to normalize conversations surrounding SRH in immigrant communities where it is highly stigmatized. 
                The goals and vision of the curriculum include (1) addressing the SRH needs of different demographics by using clear 
                terminology and avoiding jargon , (2) ensuring the curriculum is culturally sensitive and uses culturally responsive 
                language, including the importance of self-designated pronouns, (3) offering unbiased and evidence-based information 
                while acknowledging that everyone has unique circumstances and preferences, and (4) emphasizes that any information 
                that is shared or conversations that take place remain confidential in order for people to feel more comfortable 
                discussing sexual and reproductive health needs. Learning about the needs of immigrant populations may lead to higher 
                sexual health education and knowledge within these communities, which may contribute to increased feelings of 
                empowerment and bodily autonomy within immigrant populations. </Text>
              <Text>This curriculum hopes to help people understand the intersections of SRH with gender, race/ethnicity, and sexual 
                identities while challenging ethnocultural and sexual inequities in ways that would help people assert their rights 
                in areas encompassed by SRH. Our team also plans on assessing validity and reliability of information presented in 
                the curriculum, to ensure information is updated periodically. </Text>
              <Text>According to the Canadian Guidelines for Sexual Health Education, effective sexual health education should be 
                provided in an age-appropriate, culturally sensitive manner that is respectful of individual choice and that: </Text>
