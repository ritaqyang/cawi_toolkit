                <SubSubTitle> What is sexual coercion?</SubSubTitle>
                <ul className="m-list">

                    <p>Sexual coercion is any instance of a person pressuring or forcing someone else to have sex against their will, and can take many forms. Sexual coercion in a relationship is a form of intimate partner violence or a pattern of behaviors used by one partner to maintain power and control over another partner in an intimate relationship. If you are concerned about intimate partner violence, speak to a counselor and take steps to ensure your safety.

                <SubSubTitle> I gave consent, but why do I feel weird after sex or sexual activity?</SubSubTitle>
                <ul className="m-list">
                    <p>Consent is a key element of a positive sexual experience, but it is not the only factor. It is important to be aware that even if consent is given, it does not necessarily guarantee a positive sexual experience. There are many other factors that can affect the overall quality of a sexual experience, such as communication,  and physical and emotional well-being.

                    <p>It is important to remember that everyone is different, and people's feelings and bodies can be unpredictable. This is why it is important to be open and honest with your partner about your feelings and your boundaries. You should also be responsive to any changes in your partner's feelings. During an activity, you should be open to the possibility that your feelings or boundaries may change over time, and communicate those changes to your partner as they may occur.

                    </p>

                    <p>If you feel that you are unsure about an activity or experience, it is okay to take a break. You and your partner should both be comfortable throughout the experience. It is important to prioritize your own well-being and to make sure that you are in a safe and consensual environment.
